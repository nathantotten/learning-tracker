# ðŸ§  Personal Knowledge Tracker

This project is a personal tool Iâ€™m building to track what Iâ€™m learning as a developer â€” whether thatâ€™s articles, tutorials, videos, or hands-on coding practice.

Itâ€™s also a way for me to improve and solidify my skills in:
- âœ… Java & Spring Boot (backend APIs, REST design, data persistence)
- âœ… React & TypeScript (frontend UI, forms, state management)
- âœ… Full-stack development workflows (API integration, Docker, deployment)

The goal isnâ€™t to build a polished product, but to **learn by building** â€” and to grow more confident working with modern tools across the stack.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack (Current and Planned)

This project is a work in progress and will evolve as I learn more.
